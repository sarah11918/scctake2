Here's the story, of a lovely choir....

With everything up in the air and rehearsals suspended, we took advantage of some technology to boost morale and do a little singing while safely social distancing.

We're not quite sure what the rest of the choir year is going to hold, but at least we're going to spend it together... apart!
