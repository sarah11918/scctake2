. . . but "gaining a new term of choir!"

Rehearsals start up again on Tuesday, September 10 and all are welcome! We're looking forward to seeing many old and new faces as we prepare for the 2019 Christmas series. Let's finish off the decade with a real bang!

For those new to the choir, rehearsals are every Tuesday evening, 7pm to 9pm (but, let's be on the early side for the first few rehearsals since there will be new music to pick up!) at Summerside Trinity United Church, 90 Spring Street, in the basement. You can find more information on our "Joining the Choir" page.

See you soon!
