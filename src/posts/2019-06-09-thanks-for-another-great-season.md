It's a wrap!

Thank you to our amazing audience, our guest musicians from the music festival and Trinity United Church for providing such a wonderful rehearsal and performance space for us year after year.

We're going to take the summer off, and we'll be back before you know it in September.

Just a reminder that we are an open, un-auditioned choir, so if you like what you see (and hear) and are thinking about joining us next term, we're welcoming new members again in the fall!
