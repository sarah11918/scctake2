... better late than never! The choir has a COVID-19 plan and we will be able to meet for rehearsals starting October 6!

Normally we welcome new walk-in members for the first few rehearsals at the beginning of each term, but this year we can only accept people who have pre-registered their intent to participate.

So if you're a new member who would like to join us, please contact us in advance to allow us to arrange for your attendance!
