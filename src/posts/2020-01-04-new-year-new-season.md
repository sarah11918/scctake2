Are you ready for a new year of music in Summerside?

Rehearsals begin on Tuesday January 7, and we enthusiastically welcome new members to join us for the start of the term!

You can email to let us know you're coming, or simply show up at Trinity United, 90 Spring Street, Tuesday night (on the early side of 7pm, please!) with a pencil, binder and water bottle, ready to sing. Don't forget your indoor shoes/slippers if it's messy out, so we can leave our boots at the door!

It may be too early to tell if these '20s are going to be roaring, but we'll make sure they're musical, as we start things off with a term of show tunes!
