This year, the choir will be selling boxes of frozen Maritime blueberries as one of our fundraising activities. You can find lots of creative blueberry recipes online, but here's a little secret: did you know they make great ice cubes??

The choir uses the proceeds to help fund travel initiatives and for special projects, so don't leave us "blue" ... contact a choir member today and order some berries!
