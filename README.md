  Summerside Community Choir website goes legit!
</h1>

This is my attempt to rescue www.summersidechoir.ca from a well-intentioned but fatally-flawed Jekyll instance. Furthermore, I do not Ruby nor do I (properly) Liquid, so my ability to maintain and improve the site was limited.

This site is made with Gatsby.js, because I **do** (somewhat) JavaScript and I **do** React... for various definitions of "do." So, at least I have written every line of code in this project, for better or worse, and have some hope of making it do what I want.
